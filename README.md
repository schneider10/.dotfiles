# Welcome to my dotfiles!

##### Here are some things you may want...


### FZF - Fuzzy file search - https://github.com/junegunn/fzf

`brew install fzf`
#### To install useful key bindings and fuzzy completion:
`$(brew --prefix)/opt/fzf/install`


### Ripgrep - Faster than grep
`brew install ripgrep`

### Vim tooling

#### Markdown support:
- https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim
-  Use `:MarkdownPreview` to open up vim markdown in Google Chrome after installing (see vimrc).
- Todo: add hotkey for this 

##### VimWiki
My vimwiki is not yet hosted but will be soon. I'll have to first add functionality which converts markdown to html in my vimwiki folder
